## Summary

After working as a design engineer for 12 years, I decided to try myself as a trader. But due to the geopolitical situation, trading on MOEX has become difficult without market makers. Hearing from my sister about programming courses, I decided to try myself in this area. And I must say that so far I really like everything.
